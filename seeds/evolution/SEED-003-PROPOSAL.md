# SEED-003 Evolution Proposal: Bootstrap Validation

**Proposer**: KDE-INV-052  
**Date**: 2026-07-26  
**Status**: APPROVED (2026-07-26)  
**Parent Seed**: SEED-002 (Evolution)

## Executive Summary

This document proposes SEED-003 to address lessons learned from KDE-INV-051/052 regarding Bootstrap Validation. SEED-003 would establish a new reasoning foundation emphasizing verification-before-proceeding principles.

## Motivation

### Lessons Learned from SEED-002

From SEED-002's lessons learned:

> "Single responsibility degraded"
> "Experiment consistency varied"
> "No clear boundary definition"
> "Confidence model incomplete"

### New Lessons from KDE-INV-051

The KDE-INV-051 investigation revealed:

| Violation | Lesson |
|-----------|--------|
| V1: No experiment entry | Bootstrap-first must be enforced |
| V2: Pre-existence check skipped | Verify before investigating |
| V3: Environment verification omitted | Confirm capabilities before promising |

### Gap Analysis

Current seeds lack explicit bootstrap validation principles:

| Principle | SEED-001 | SEED-002 | SEED-003 (Proposed) |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Verification before proceeding | Implicit | Implicit | **Explicit** |
| Evidence preservation | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Confidence calibration | Partial | Partial | **Complete** |
| Bootstrap enforcement | None | None | **Required** |

## Proposed SEED-003 Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Bootstrap-First Verification**
   > Before any action, verify the environment and acknowledge constraints.

2. **Pre-Existence Validation**
   > Verify that reported issues actually exist before investing investigation effort.

3. **Capability-Aware Commitment**
   > Only promise what the verified environment can deliver.

4. **Evidence-Traceable Reasoning**
   > Every conclusion must trace to documented evidence.

5. **Confidence-Calibrated Claims**
   > Adjust confidence based on evidence quality and verification completeness.

## Proposed Changes

### Principles Addition

SEED-003 would add:

```
principles/bootstrap-validation/
├── bootstrap-first.md      # Verification before proceeding
├── pre-existence.md        # Check before investigating
├── capability-aware.md     # Promise only what's possible
├── evidence-trace.md       # Trace all conclusions
└── confidence-calibrate.md # Calibrate confidence
```

### Scientific Loop Enhancement

The scientific loop would be enhanced with:

```
Phase 0: Bootstrap Verification (NEW)
├── Verify environment
├── Check prerequisites
├── Confirm capabilities
└── Acknowledge constraints

Phase 1-6: Existing scientific loop (from SEED-002)

Phase 7: Validation Enhancement
├── Verify evidence chain
├── Calibrate confidence
└── Document limitations
```

## Success Criteria

| Criterion | Metric | Target |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Bootstrap violation rate | Violations per investigation | < 0.1 |
| Pre-existence check compliance | % investigations with check | > 95% |
| Environment verification | % investigations with verification | > 95% |
| Evidence traceability | Claims with evidence | 100% |
